# Single Point Plot

In this task, you will plot a single data point. This exercise is meant to show that even one point can be plotted, which is a great starting point when youâ€™re new to Matplotlib.

**Instructions:**
1. Define a single coordinate for `x` and `y`.
2. Use `ax.plot()` with a marker (and no connecting line) to display the point.
3. Add a title using `ax.set_title()`.

Modify the code below and click **Run Code**.

import PythonRunner from "../../components/PythonRunner";

<PythonRunner initialCode={`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a single data point
x = [2]
y = [3]

# Plot the single point using a circle marker
ax.plot(x, y, marker='o', linestyle='None', color='r')

# Add a title to the plot
ax.set_title("Single Point Plot")
`} />
