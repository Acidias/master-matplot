# Basic Line Plot

In this task, you will create a simple line plot that connects a series of points. This exercise is designed to introduce you to plotting data with Matplotlib.

**Instructions:**
1. Define two lists, `x` and `y`, that represent your data points.
2. Use `ax.plot()` to draw a line through the points.
3. Add a title to your plot with `ax.set_title()`.

Modify the code below and click **Run Code**.

import PythonRunner from "../../components/PythonRunner";

<PythonRunner initialCode={`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the data points
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Plot the line with markers at each point
ax.plot(x, y, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='b')

# Add a title to the plot
ax.set_title("Simple Line Plot")
`} />
