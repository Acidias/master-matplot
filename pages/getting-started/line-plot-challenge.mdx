# Line Plot Challenge

In this challenge, you will create a simple line plot that connects a series of points.

**Your tasks:**
1. Define two lists, `x` and `y`, representing your data points.
2. Use `ax.plot()` to draw a line through the points.
3. Add a title to your plot using `ax.set_title()`.

Try to solve the challenge by editing the code below, then click **Run Code**.

import PythonRunner from "../../components/PythonRunner";

<PythonRunner initialCode={`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Write your code below:
`} />

import ShowSolution from "../../components/ShowSolution"

<ShowSolution
  solution={`
**Solution:**

\`\`\`python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the data points
x=[0,1,2,3,4,5]
y = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Plot the line with markers
ax.plot(x, y, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='b')

# Title
ax.set_title("Simple Line Plot")
\`\`\`
`}
/>
